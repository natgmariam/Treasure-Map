/*

Description: This program reads in a treasure map file, starting with a starting position
and direction to face, and then a series of instructions on how to reach a treasure.

The two instructions are to pace (walk directly forward) and to turn.
These two instructions will be implemented using a custom ComplexNumber class,
representing a complex number in 2D space and having three operations:
An operation to multiply two ComplexNumbers (rotate)
An operation to multiply a scalar by a ComplexNumber (travel some distance in a direction)
An operation to add two ComplexNumber (adjust a position by a vector)

This main file will do error checking, read in the treasure map using the >> overload,
find the treasure by following the instructions, and then print the results using the << overload

Input: File name of the map to read and use
Output: Steps of the map to reach the treasure
